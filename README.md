# uvb-spike-a

It's been one too many times that I caught myself lamenting: "I wish I could use [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu) *inside* the browser" â€¦so finally down the rabbit hole I go (before uvu gets even bigger). 

This typically happens when I'm forced to prototype against the DOM and I don't want to hobbled/slowed down by a faux JavaScript implementation. In this case is [lexical](https://lexical.dev/)'s fault.
